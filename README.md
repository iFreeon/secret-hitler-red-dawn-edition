# Secret Hitler Red Dawn Expansion
Step into an era of heightened political tension and espionage with the Red Dawn Expansion for the acclaimed social deduction game, Secret Hitler.  

## Design Principals
1. Game setting is 1933 where liberal parties are trying to hold together a fragile republic. Historically this is one year before the establishment of the Third Reich. 
2. Love the 3rd faction idea. This expansion will use Communists. 
3. 14 players seems like the sweet spot for max players.
4. Pull inspiration from original, socialist and XL expansions but treat this as a stand alone game. Explain the player motivation, win conditions, setup (board, player, policy), flow, and optional items.  
5. Game mechanics and balancing focus game boards, player faction mix, policy card mix, and extras. 
6. Win conditions must be unique and distinct to each faction.  No shared win conditions.   
7. Secret roles should advance or hinder a faction. Avoid roles with personal win conditions as this takes away from group dynamic.
